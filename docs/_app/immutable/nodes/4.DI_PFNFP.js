The aim was a minimum: as few words as possible, as much coverage as possible. According to the language researchers who made them, the words on them were found to be among the most useful and common words, across the widest range of everyday situations. A word made the list because it appeared often enough, across enough contexts, to be hard to avoid for the average person in an English-speaking society. </p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That's what makes them interesting beyond language education. Both lists cover most of the language people encounter in everyday use – over 90% for the 2023 list, and about 84% for the 1953 one. That makes them, in effect, two portraits of ordinary life, seventy years apart. Each one is a record of what the world, at that time, asked people to have words for.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To get at what exactly ordinary life consists of, according to the lists, I went through the differences from a few angles: what the words are about, how tangible they are, and what kind of grammatical work they do in a sentence. Examined together, the gaps all seem to point to a certain kind of world, one that got both bigger and less immediate at the same time.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I started by running all the words through a semantic tagging framework common in linguistics research. It assigns each word to a subject category based on typical usage: Food and Farming, the Body and the Self, Government and Public, Language and Communication, and so on. Twenty-one categories overall. Together, they suggest what kind of world each list was built for.</p>"
