I take the published materials as given and rely on coverage figures from the list authors and from follow-up studies (including an independent check on American English by Stoeckel, 2019 – see footnotes).

For example, <i>hammer, nail,</i> and <i>wax</i> are all tagged “General and Abstract Terms”, but in USAS’s finer tags, they read as actions (“to hammer,” “to nail,” “to wax”), not objects. Out of context, many of these words go multiple ways, and it didn’t feel right to override that case by case; USAS is an established linguistic framework, and swapping in my own judgment would mix two different standards.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For the second chart, I grouped USAS’s 21 categories into five “scope” domains (self, local, institutional, social, abstract).
