I labeled words appearing on both lists as “remained” (1,656), words only on the 1953 list as “removed” (628), and words only on the 2023 list as “added” (1,153).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The GSL words came from the <a href=https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:General_Service_List target=_blank>Simple English Wiktionary GSL</a>. The NGSL words came from the <a href=https://www.newgeneralservicelist.com/new-general-service-list#:~:text=NGSL%201.2%20alphabetized%20and%20lemmatized%20for%20research target=_blank>official NGSL 1.2 file</a> (“alphabetized and lemmatized for research”).\\r\\nThe NGSL uses lemmas (one entry per word family); the GSL sometimes lists inflected forms as separate headwords. These lists track word forms deemed worth teaching based on frequency and usefulness, not abstract concepts. For example, the word <i>being</i> is on the GSL as its own headword and was not included in the NGSL, But this doesn’t mean the concept of existence left the language. In the NGSL it falls under <i>be</i>, which is on both lists.</p>"

About 84% of general English for the GSL and about 90% for the NGSL, depending on the text and how words are counted. I did not re-run those corpus analyses myself. I take the published materials as given and rely on coverage figures from the list authors and from follow-up studies (including an independent check on American English by Stoeckel, 2019 – see footnotes). That’s why the differences between the lists felt worth examining as more than a curriculum update, with the caveat that neither list is a neutral census of culture.</p>"

For example, <i>hammer, nail,</i> and <i>wax</i> are all tagged “General and Abstract Terms”, but in USAS’s finer tags, they read as actions (“to hammer,” “to nail,” “to wax”), not objects. Out of context, many of these words go multiple ways, and it didn’t feel right to override that case by case; USAS is an established linguistic framework, and swapping in my own judgment would mix two different standards.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For the second chart, I grouped USAS’s 21 categories into five “scope” domains (self, local, institutional, social, abstract).
